        <h3>Hi, thanks for checking out my site! My name is Alex Maranto, and I'm an aspiring software engineer.<br>
            I've worked primarily in the hospitality and entertainment industries, but during the COVID lockdown<br>
            I was able to get a remote job doing music research for Meta's Music Research team.<br>
            After getting a taste of the WFH life, I decided to enroll in the full-stack software engineering<br>
            course at Coding Temple once my project ended, in order to expand my career opportunities!<br><br>
            My primary focus has always been music. I started playing the violin when I was 9, and have since<br>
            learned how to play as many instruements as possible. I've worked as a music director at a church,<br>
            and have had the good fortune to be able to go on multiple full U.S. tours, with a few different bands.<br>
            More info about my projects can be found <a href="band.html" class="more-info">here</a>!
        </h3>
